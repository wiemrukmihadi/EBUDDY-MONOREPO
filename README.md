## Personality & technical Questions

What are the most difficult technical problems in your work experience you have encountered and how do you fix them?

###
While working on a Firestore-based ranking system, I needed to rank users based on multiple weighted factors (ratings, activity, and engagement) while ensuring efficient pagination. Firestore's indexing system doesn’t support true multi-factor ranking directly.

Task:
I had to implement an efficient ranking system that combines multiple sorting criteria and supports cursor-based pagination.

###
When you’re working on a project, how do you typically approach it from start to finish? 
    - I start by gathering and analyzing project requirements
    - Break down the project into clear, manageable tasks and prioritize them
    - Development
    - Testing & Debugging
    - Deployment and monitoring
###
How do you usually approach learning a new topic to absorb as much as possible?
    - Set Clear Learning Goals
    - Find the Best Learning Resources
    - Apply Knowledge Immediately (Learn by Doing) 
    -  Take Notes & Summarize Key Concepts
    - Review & Revisit Concepts
 ### 
 “Consistency” vs “fast & efficient”. Choose one.

 It depends on the context, but if I have to choose one, I’d go with Fast & Efficient ⚡.

Why?
In tech (especially startups & Web3), speed matters—getting features out fast and iterating based on feedback is crucial.
Efficiency means doing more with less—writing clean, optimized code rather than just following rigid processes.
When Consistency Wins
If I’m working on long-term scalability (e.g., database architecture, security, testing), consistency is key to prevent tech debt.

### 
Do you own any Apple products? Like IMac, Macbook, Ipad, Iphone, etc…
